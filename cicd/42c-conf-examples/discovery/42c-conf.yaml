# This example shows how the OpenAPI files can be discovered
# based on their filenames. In particular, it will look for
# all files with json, yaml and yml extensions in all directories
# with the exception of the 'foo/' directory. All files in 'foo/' will
# be ignored regardless of their extension.
#
# The 'search' list must contain inclusion patterns followed by exclusion
# patterns. Each exclusion pattern must start with ! (exclamation mark).
# Format of the pattern is a glob expression, similar to format of .gitignore.
#
# The result of the OpenAPi disovery in this folder will be as follows:
#
# Discovered: petstore.yaml, bar/petstore.json 
#
# Files in 'foo/' will not be discovered.
