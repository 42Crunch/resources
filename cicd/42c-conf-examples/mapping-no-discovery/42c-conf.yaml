# This example shows how to switch off discovering any new API files and 
# only audit the API files you have specifically mapped to existing 
# APIs in 42Crunch Platform.
#
# Discovery phase is enabled by default, otherwise the CI/CD integration
# plugin would not find any API files to audit. However, if you map the
# filenames of the API definitions that you want to include to
# the API UUIDs in the platform, you can exclude any other files.
#
# When the plugin starts, it begins with cleaning the 
# API collection you have defined it to use. That is why the mapping 
# must be done to another API collection.
#
# The plugin uploads any APIs it finds during the discovery phase
# to 42Crunch Platform, so the APIs always get new API UUIDs. Mapping is also 
# useful if you want to preserve API UUIDs across separate audit runs.  
#
# To configure the mapping, you must know the API UUID of the existing API
# in 42Crunch Platform (you can check it in the API summary on 
# the platform). You list the filenames and the corresponding API UUIDs 
# in the 'mapping' section. To switch off the discovery phase for any
# unmapped files, specify 'discovery: false', as shown below.
#
# In this example, the sample 'petstore.json' is uploaded to the platform, 
# updating the API with the UUID 'e7cd62ce-1ee9-4320-af33-8bd9519c6f48'
# with its contents. The sample 'petstore.yaml' is not uploaded to 
# the platform at all.

audit:
  mapping:
    petstore.json: e7cd62ce-1ee9-4320-af33-8bd9519c6f48
  discovery: false
