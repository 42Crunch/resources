# This example shows how to 'map' files to existing APIs already
# created on 42Crunch Platform.
#
# Mapping is useful if you wish to preserve API IDs across 
# audit runs, because when files found through the discovery
# process are uploaded to the 42Crunch Platform they will
# always get new API IDs. 
#
# To configure a mapping for an OpenAPI file you need to know
# 42Cunch Platform API ID to map file to.
#
# Mapping can be combined with discovery, which is 
# enabled by default. However, any files listed in
# mapping section will be ignored by discovery process.
#
# In this example 'petstore.json' file will be uploaded to the platform
# updating API ID e7cd62ce-1ee9-4320-af33-8bd9519c6f48 with its contents.
#
# The 'petstore.yaml' found through the discovery process will be uploaded
# to the platform getting a new API ID.
