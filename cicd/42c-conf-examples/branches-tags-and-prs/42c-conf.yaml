# This example shows how to configure failure conditions based on the branch name,
# tag name, or PR target branch.
#
# When the CI/CD plugin starts, it creates an API collection in 42Crunch Platform
# using the name of the repository and branch, tag, or PR directly from your source control.
#
# If you run the plugin on multiple branches, tags, or PRs in the same repository,
# the plugin creates a separate API collection for each of them.
#
# You can specify the plugin configuration individually for each branch, tag, or PR in your repository.
# You can also use wildcards for the branch names to apply the configuration to all
# branches with matching names.
#
# You can use wildcards * and ** (see the example below): * matches
# any character except /, while ** matches any characters including /.
#
# In the example below, the branch called "main" has been configured to fail
# if the minimum data validation score is under 70, and any branch with a name matching
# the wildcard pattern feature-* to fail if the data validation score is under 50.
# All other branches are caught by the pattern ** and are configured to fail if
# the data validation score is under 60.
#
# Additionally, you can specify plugin configuration for individual tags and PRs as shown below.
# Configurations for PRs are matched based on the PR target branch, so you can, for example,
# specify that PRs targeting the main branch require higher score than PRs targeting other branches.
