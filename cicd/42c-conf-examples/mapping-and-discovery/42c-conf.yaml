# This example shows how to map discovered API files to APIs you already have
# in another API collection in 42Crunch Platform.
#
# When the CI/CD integration plugin starts, it begins with cleaning the 
# API collection you have defined it to use. That is why the mapping 
# must be done to another API collection.
#
# The plugin uploads any APIs it finds during the discovery phase
# to 42Crunch Platform, so the APIs always get new API UUIDs. Mapping is useful 
# if you want to preserve API UUIDs across separate audit runs.  
#
# To configure the mapping, you must know the API UUID of the existing API
# in 42Cunch Platform (you can check it in the API summary on 
# the platform). You list the filenames and the corresponding API UUIDs 
# in the 'mapping' section.
#
# In this example, the sample 'petstore.json' file is mapped and is uploaded
# to the platform updating the API with the UUID 'e7cd62ce-1ee9-4320-af33-8bd9519c6f48' 
# with its contents.
#
# On the other hand, the sample 'petstore.yaml' found in the discovery phase is uploaded
# to the platform as a new API, getting a new API UUID.
