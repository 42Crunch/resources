# This example shows how to 'map' files to existing APIs already
# created on 42Crunch Platform.
#
# Mapping is useful if you wish to preserve API IDs across 
# audit runs, because when files found through the discovery
# process are uploaded to the 42Crunch Platform they will
# always get new API IDs. 
#
# To configure a mapping for an OpenAPI file you need to know
# 42Cunch Platform API ID to map file to.
#
# Mapping can be combined with discovery, which is 
# enabled by default. However if you wish to disable
# discovery, you can do it by setting "discovery: false"
# as shown below.
#
# This will result in 'petstore.json' uploaded to the platform updating 
# API ID e7cd62ce-1ee9-4320-af33-8bd9519c6f48 its contents.
# The 'petstore.yaml' will not be uploaded to the platform at all.
