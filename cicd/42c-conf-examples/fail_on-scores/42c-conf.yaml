# The audit score is split in two categories, Security and Data validation. The maximum score
# for Security is 30 points and for Data validation 70 points. Together, they form 
# the overall audit score, maximum 100 points.
#
# With most plugins, you can set the minimum audit score that API definitions must reach
# when you add the task to your CI/CD pipeline. 

# You can use the Security and Data validation categories to impose 
# additional restrictions on the audited APIs. Just specify a minimum score for one or both of them
# in the 'fail_on' section, as below.
# 
# In this example, the sample 'petstore.json' will result in two additional failures
# as the API scores less in data validation than the 70 points specified in 'data'
# and less in security than the 30 points specified in 'security'.
