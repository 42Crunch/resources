# All security risks that the security audit reports also indicate how severe the issue is. 
# There are five severity levels: critical, high, medium, low, and info.
#
# You can specify how severe issues should cause the task to fail. Just add the severity level
# you want to the 'fail_on' section. 
#
# If the audit discovers any issue where severity equals or  is higher
# than what you configured, the issue is reported as a failure.
