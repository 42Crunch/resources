# In addition to the main audit score, there are two sub-scores
# which can be used to impose additional restrictions on audited API.
#
# These are "security" and "data" scores.  Maximum possible value for
# "security" score is 30 and the maximum value for "data" score is 70.
#
# One or both of these values can be specified in fail_on section.
# 
# Configuration in this example will result in two additional failures
# in audit of 'petstore.yaml' as this APIs "data" score is lower than 70
# and its security score is lower than 30
