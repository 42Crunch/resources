# All issues reported by the audit have IDs which uniquely identify
# each issue.
#
# It is possible to specify one or more issue IDs which, if encountered
# during the audit will cause a failure.
#
# Each entry in issue_id section is a regular expression which is
# used to check issue IDs reported by the audit.
# 
# In case of the example below, these falures will be reported:
#
#  Found issue "v3-global-security"
#  Found issue "v3-response-schema-undefined"
#  Found issue "v3-schema-array-maxitems"
#  Found issue "v3-schema-numerical-max"
#  Found issue "v3-schema-numerical-min"
#  Found issue "v3-schema-object-additionalproperties-true"
