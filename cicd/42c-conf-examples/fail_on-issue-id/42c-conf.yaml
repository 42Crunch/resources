# All issues that API Contract Security Audit reports have issue IDs which uniquely identify
# each issue.
#
# If there are issues that you want to fail the task on the CI/CD pipeline, you can specify their issue IDs in the 'fail_on' conditions for your plugin. 
# If the plugin encounters these issue IDs during the audit, it reports each as a failure.
#
# Each entry in the 'issue_id' section is a regular expression that is
# used to check issue IDs that the audit reports.
# 
# In this example, audit reports the following failures on the sample 'petstore.json':
#
#  'Found issue "v3-global-security"'
#  'Found issue "v3-response-schema-undefined"'
#  'Found issue "v3-schema-array-maxitems"'
#  'Found issue "v3-schema-numerical-max"'
#  'Found issue "v3-schema-numerical-min"'
#  'Found issue "v3-schema-object-additionalproperties-true"'
#  'Found issue "v3-schema-string-maxlength"'
#  'Found issue "v3-schema-string-pattern"'
