# This example shows how to configure failure conditions based on the branch name.
#
# When the CI/CD plugin starts, it creates an API collection in 42Crunch Platform
# using the name of the repository and branch directly from your source control.
#
# If you run the plugin on multiple branches in the same repository,
# the plugin creates a separate API collection for each branch.
#
# You can specify the plugin configuration individually for each branch in your repository.
# You can also use wildcards for the branch names to apply the configuration to all
# branches with matching names.
#
# In the following example, the branch called "main" has been configured to fail
# if the minimum data validation score is under 70, and any branch with a name matching
# the wildcard pattern "feature-*" to fail if the data validation score is under 50.
# 
# All other branches are caught by the pattern "*" and are configured to fail if
# the data validation score is under 60.
