# By default, an API definition that does not fully conform to 
# the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is reported as a failure.
#
# For example, the sample 'petstore.json' in this example does not have the 'paths' attribute defined,
# which is something that the OAS requiresth. Trying to audit this file results in the report
# "The OpenAPI definition is not valid".
#
# You can switch this off by setting 'invalid_contract' to 'false',
# as shown below.
