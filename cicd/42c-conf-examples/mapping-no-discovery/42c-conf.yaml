# This example shows how to switch off discovering any new API files and 
# only audit the API files you have specifically mapped to existing 
# APIs in 42Crunch Platform.
#
# When the CI/CD plugin starts, it creates an API collection in 42Crunch Platform
# using the name of the repository and branch directly from your source control.
#
# The plugin uploads any APIs it finds during the discovery phase
# into this API collection. On subsequent runs, the collection
# is kept is sync with the API files in your source repository.
#
# Discovery is enabled by default. However, you can switch it off 
# and rely solely on mappings if you do not want to use discovery.
#
# To configure the mapping, you must know the API UUID of the existing API
# in 42Crunch Platform (you can check it in the API summary on 
# the platform). You list the filenames and the corresponding API UUIDs 
# in the 'mapping' section. To switch off the discovery phase for any
# unmapped files, specify 'discovery: false', as shown below.
#
# In this example, the sample 'petstore.json' is uploaded to the platform, 
# updating the API with the UUID 'e7cd62ce-1ee9-4320-af33-8bd9519c6f48'
# with its contents. The sample 'petstore.yaml' is unmapped and thus 
# is not uploaded to the platform at all.

audit:
  branches:
    main:
      mapping:
        petstore.json: e7cd62ce-1ee9-4320-af33-8bd9519c6f48
      discovery: false
