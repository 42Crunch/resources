# This example shows how the OpenAPI files can be discovered
# based on their filenames. The discovery phase will look for
# all files with '.json', '.yaml', and '.yml' extensions in all directories,
# except in the 'foo/' directory. All files in 'foo/' will
# be ignored regardless of their extension.
#
# The 'search' list must contain inclusion patterns followed by any exclusion
# patterns. Each exclusion pattern must start with '!' (exclamation mark).
# Format of the pattern is a glob expression, similar to format in '.gitignore'.
#
# The result of this example and its samples is as follows:
#
# 'Discovered: petstore.yaml, bar/petstore.json '
#
# Files in 'foo/' are not discovered.
