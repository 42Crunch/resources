# This example shows how to use the collection mode with default configuration.
#
# In collection mode, you can point the plugin to search for OpenAPI files in a directory in your 
# source code repository and to compile the discovered APIs into specific API collections with your 
# pre-defined settings. You can specify multiple directories, each with their designated API collection, 
# search patterns, and sharing settings.
# 
# The 'default' under 'audit' specifies that this is the default configuration that the plugin applies to 
# any CI/CD run _unless_ it finds a more specific one for a particular branch, tag, or PR. For mode details on
# how to define configurations for a specific branch, tag, or PR, see the example "branches-tags-and-prs".
#
# The plugin scans the directories specified in the configuration for OpenAPI files and 
# uploads them to API collections in 42Crunch Platform as specified by technical names under 'collections' 
# (here 'foo' and 'bar'). If a particular API collection in the configuration does not exist in the platform, 
# the plugin creates it.
# 
# Required properties for each API collection:
# - 'dir': The relative path to the directory that the plugin scans.
#
# You can also define the following optional properties:
# - 'search': A list of glob patterns for file discovery (defaults to standard OpenAPI extensions). 
#             The 'search' list must contain inclusion patterns followed by any exclusion
#             patterns. Each exclusion pattern must start with '!' (exclamation mark).
#             The format of the pattern is a glob expression, similar to format in '.gitignore'.
# - 'teams': Sharing the API collection with particular teams in your organization, including the 
#            level of access (permissions) each team has to the collection. 
#            Keys under 'teams' must be names of existing teams in your organization (here 'TeamOne').
#            Permissions ('read', 'write', 'delete') are applied ONLY when a new API collection is created, 
#            not to already existing collections.
# - 'api_tags': List of tags to be applied to APIs in the API collection. Tags are only applied to new APIs, not APIs already in the collection.
# - 'ignore_failures': If set to 'true', the plugin does not stop the CI/CD pipeline if the audit step fails. 
#                      If set to 'false', the pipeline stops on failure.
# - 'collection_name': The (friendly) name for the API collection shown on the UI in addition to the technical name.
#
# The result of the configuration example below would be:
# - APIs found in the directory 'foo/' will be uploaded to the API collection called "foo", no other behavior options specified.
# - APIs found in the directory 'bar/' will be uploaded to the APi collection called "bar", failing the audit step does not stop the pipeline.
