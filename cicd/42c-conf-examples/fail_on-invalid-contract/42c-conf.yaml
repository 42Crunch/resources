# Trying to audit a file which does not fully conform to the OpenAPI
# specification will result in a falure.
#
# For example if the file being checked does not have "paths" attribute,
# which is required by specification, the failure
# "The OpenAPI definition is not valid" will be reported.
#
# This check however can be disabled by setting "invalid_contract" to false
# as shown below.

audit:
  fail_on:
    invalid_contract: false
